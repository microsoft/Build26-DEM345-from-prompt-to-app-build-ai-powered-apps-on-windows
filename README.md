# 🚀 Get Started

**This repo is where attendees go to continue their learning after your session — and your Copilot agent will help you set it up.**

### Step 1: Open your repo

Open this repo in a **Codespace** (click the green **Code** button → **Create a Codespace**) — or clone it locally. Then open **GitHub Copilot Chat**.

### Step 2: Add your content

Give the agent something to work with. Drag files into the Explorer panel — session abstracts, outlines, screenshots, notes — and drop them in one of two places:

| Where to put it | What goes there | Who sees it |
|---|---|---|
| **`_remove-before-publish/`** | Internal reference materials (abstracts, outlines, screenshots, planning docs) | **Copilot only** — never published |
| **`/docs/`, `/src/`, or repo root** | Lab instructions, demo code, sample data, getting-started guides | **Attendees** — published with the repo |

> 💡 Not sure? Start by dropping your session abstract or outline into `_remove-before-publish/`. The agent will figure out what to do with it.

### Step 3: Ask the Agent

Once your content is in the repo, use these three phrases with Copilot to build out your session repo:

| Phrase to use with Copilot | What it does | When to run it |
|---|---|---|
| **"Help me get started"** | Sets up session title, description, outcomes, and owners | After you've added your session abstract or outline to the repo |
| **"Help me refine content"** | Organizes your session content into the repo | Each time you add or update content |
| **"Help me finalize"** | Final review, cleanup, and publication prep | When you're ready to publish |

> 💡 **These three phrases are just the starting point.** Copilot can do much more — try asking it to brainstorm next steps for attendees, generate code samples, or build out your repo structure. Don't be afraid to put it in plan mode and ask for what you need.

# [Microsoft Build 2026](https://build.microsoft.com)

## 🔥 DEM345: From Prompt to App: Build AI-powered apps on Windows

### Session Description

Build a real Windows app by iterating with agents, then make it production-real with platform integrations like Windows App SDK, Windows ML, Windows AI APIs, and local LLM backends such as Foundry Local.

### 🚀 Getting started

If you're following these steps at your own pace:
- Clone this repository
- Set up your development environment
- <!-- step 3 -->

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this demo, you will be able to:

- Build and iterate a native Windows app workflow using agent-driven prompts from concept to working UI.
- Integrate local AI capabilities for media scenarios using Windows Machine Learning and Windows AI APIs.
- Add a configurable local model backend using Foundry Local to support hardware-aware, offline-first experiences.

### 💬 Keep Learning with Copilot

Try these prompts with GitHub Copilot to explore the topics from this demo. Open Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+I` on Mac), paste a prompt, and see what you learn. Try connecting the [Microsoft Learn MCP Server](#-microsoft-learn-mcp-server) for the latest official documentation.

Use these as a starting point — or write your own!

<!-- Prompts will be tailored to this session's content during repo setup. -->
